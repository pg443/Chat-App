This program is built totally on Python 3. To run it, user need to have installed Python 3.4 and above.
The following Python libraries has been used and they need to be installed on the system
            datetime
            zlib
            socket
            tkinter
            threading
            xml
            random
            string
            collections
Generally all of them are built into Official Python 3.4 and above install.
Run command 'help("modules")' to get the list of installed modules and verify installation.

pdu library resides in the file pdu.py and it must be in the folder with client.py and/or server.py


Implemetation is very buggy due to the limited amount of time and experience in network programming
So it might seem to stop because of server's multithreading implementation and global interpretor lock


All features have been implemented on the server but not implemented on the client because of the tkinter GUI limitation
Tkinter comes with python and it is very basic and primitive GUI API.
Feature not implemented on GUI: sending file, seeing last seen and typing status

Tkinter is used because it is very basic and uses OS libraries to form windows and widgets, 
hence the same code should run same on almost every kind of OS

But the operating system used to build the program is Debian Buster with Linux kernel 5.0
The program is best viewed in Debian based linux installations
